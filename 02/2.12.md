$$\phi: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$$
$$\phi(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v} M$$
The nullspace is equivalent to the ideal of $\phi$.

The rank of $M$ is 2 which means that the basis of $\phi$'s
output space is a vector of size 2.
Therefore the matrix is nondegenerate the output can be
expressed in terms of $u, v$.

$$(a, b, c) M = (a a_1 + b a_2 + c a_3, a b_1 + b b_2 + c b_3)$$
$$\implies a a_2 + b a_2 + c a_3 = 0, a b_1 + b b_2 + c b_3 = 0$$

Multiply the first equation by $u$, and second by $v$, then it can
projected by the given equations, with the identity holding true.
$$ax + by + cz = 0 \in \mathbb{P}_K^2$$
