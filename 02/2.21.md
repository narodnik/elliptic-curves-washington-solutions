$$u = t - 1, v = mt$$
Process is:
1. Set gradient of curve. $m = +\ifnty$ corresponds to vertical line,
   $m = 0$ corresponds to horizontal line crossing $(1, 0)$.
   $m = -\ifnty$ corresponds to vertical line in the other direction.
2. Solve for $t$
3. Use $t$ to find $u, v$
$$t^2 - 2t + m^2 t^2 = 0$$
$$t(1 + m^2) = 2$$
$$u = \frac{1 - m^2}{1 + m^2}$$
$$v = \frac{2m}{1 + m^2}$$
