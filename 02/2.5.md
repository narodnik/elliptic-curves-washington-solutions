**Let $(x, y)$ be on the elliptic curve $E$ given by
$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$. Show that if $y = 0$ then $3x^2 + A \neq 0$.
(*Hint:* What is the condition for a polynomial to have $x$
as a multiple root?)**

An elliptic curve is smooth and non-singular with no self intersections.

Polynomials which touch but do not cross the $y$-axis have multiple
roots and $3x^2 + A = 0$ when $y = 0$. Since elliptic curves do not
have this property, therefore $3x^2 + A \neq 0$.
